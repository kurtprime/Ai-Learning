I don't have "modes" like some other AI systems (e.g., strict vs. creative modes). I operate with a balanced approach by defaultâ€”providing accurate, clear, and context-aware responses while adapting to your needs.  

If you'd like me to adjust my style (e.g., more concise, highly technical, or beginner-friendly), just let me know! I can tailor my responses to fit your preference for any given task.  

How can I assist you today? ðŸ˜Š
